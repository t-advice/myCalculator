# MyCalculator

This project is a simple console-based calculator built in C# (.NET 9) to help me learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- User-friendly console interface
- Continuous operation until the user chooses to exit

## OOP and Inheritance

To deepen my understanding of OOP, I structured the calculator using classes for each operation. I used inheritance to share common functionality between these classes, demonstrating how base and derived classes work together in C#.

## Purpose

This calculator was created as a learning exercise to explore and apply OOP principles, especially inheritance, in a practical project.
